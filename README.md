## About Me!
- Hello everyone! I am a software developer who has a passion for software development and problem solving. I have always loved creating projects and solving puzzles and software development was a perfect blend of both worlds. Joining LearningFuze allowed me to pursue that passion and further my skills.

LearningFuze is a program that focuses on teaching JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, React and Node in a real world working environment. Beyond technical expertise, Iâ€™ve developed strong collaborative and communication skills, enabling me to thrive in team-oriented projects and deliver impactful results.

I am eager to leverage my technical knowledge and problem-solving mindset to contribute to meaningful projects, continuously learn, and make a positive impact in the tech industry.
